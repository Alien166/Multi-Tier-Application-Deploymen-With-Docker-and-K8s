# Multi-Tier-Application-Deploymen-With-Docker-and-K8s

## Overview

This repository contains the configuration and setup for deploying a multi-tier application using Docker and Kubernetes. The project is designed to demonstrate how to build and deploy a scalable, fault-tolerant application architecture using modern containerization and orchestration technologies.

## Project Components

### 1. **Frontend Service (Nginx)**
- **Description**: Serves the user interface for the application.
- **Dockerfile**: Configures the Docker image for the Nginx web server.
- **Configuration**: Includes `nginx.conf` to define server behavior and `index.html` for the static content served by Nginx.

### 2. **Backend Service (Flask)**
- **Description**: Handles business logic and API requests.
- **Dockerfile**: Configures the Docker image for the Flask application.
- **Requirements**: `requirements.txt` lists Python dependencies required by the Flask application.
- **Application**: `app.py` contains the Flask application code, implementing the API endpoints.

### 3. **Database Service (MySQL)**
- **Description**: Manages data storage for the application.
- **Image**: Uses the official MySQL image from Docker Hub.
- **Configuration**: Includes necessary environment variables for initializing the MySQL database.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines and runs the multi-container Docker application. It includes:
- **Frontend Service**: Nginx, serving the static content.
- **Backend Service**: Flask application, handling API requests.
- **Database Service**: MySQL, managing the application data.
- **Networks**: Configures `mynetwork` to enable communication between services.

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes manifests are provided to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster. The manifests include:
- **Deployments**: Define the deployment specifications for frontend, backend, and database services.
- **Services**: Define how each component is exposed and accessed within the cluster.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Manage configuration and sensitive data.
- **Ingress**: (If used) Provides external access to the frontend service, configured to handle routing and load balancing.

## Features

- **Auto-Scaling**: Configured to scale application components based on demand.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the services.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated monitoring for tracking application health and performance.

## Getting Started

1. **Build Docker Images**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/frontend:latest .
   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/backend:latest .
